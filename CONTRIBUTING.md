## 🏅 GSSoC Point System & Labels

To ensure points are awarded correctly, we follow a strict labeling system for all PRs. 

### 1. Difficulty Labels (Choose ONLY ONE)
Every PR must have one difficulty label.
*   `level:beginner` → very easy fixes, typo fixes, simple UI changes
*   `level:intermediate` → moderate feature/fix, API integration, medium logic
*   `level:advanced` → complex features, architecture changes, optimization
*   `level:critical` → major system/security/core changes

**Example:**
*   Small README update → `level:beginner`
*   Authentication system → `level:advanced`

### 2. Quality Labels (Optional)
Add if the PR quality is good. Do NOT add both together normally. Choose one if deserved.
*   `quality:clean` → well-structured code
*   `quality:exceptional` → outstanding work

### 3. Type Labels (Optional but Recommended)
These give bonus points. Use according to the work done:
*   `type:docs`
*   `type:testing`
*   `type:accessibility`
*   `type:design`
*   `type:performance`
*   `type:refactor`
*   `type:devops`
*   `type:security`
*   `type:bug`
*   `type:feature`

**Examples:**
*   New dashboard → `type:feature`
*   README improvement → `type:docs`
*   Speed optimization → `type:performance`

*You can add multiple type labels if valid.*

### 4. Validation Labels (VERY IMPORTANT)
These decide whether points count.

**Valid PR**
Add:
*   `gssoc:approved`

**Invalid PR**
Use only if necessary. If you add any invalid/spam label, the contributor gets 0 points:
*   `gssoc:invalid`
*   `gssoc:spam`
*   `gssoc:ai slop`

### 5. Mentor Label
If mentors review PRs, this gives mentor review points:
*   `mentor:username` (Example: `mentor:rahul`, `mentor:aniket`)

### Recommended Label Combination Examples

*   **Example 1 — Good Feature PR:** `level:intermediate`, `type:feature`, `quality:clean`, `gssoc:approved`
*   **Example 2 — Documentation PR:** `level:beginner`, `type:docs`, `gssoc:approved`
*   **Example 3 — Excellent Security Fix:** `level:advanced`, `type:security`, `quality:exceptional`, `gssoc:approved`

### 🚨 Most Important Rule
For contributor points, a PR must:
✅ Be merged
✅ Have at least one review
✅ Have `gssoc:approved`

**Without `gssoc:approved`, no score is counted.**

> **Pro Tip:** Always comment `"Please assign this to me"` on an issue and **wait for the Project Admin or Mentor to assign it to you** before you start working! This avoids overlapping work.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture Overview

Before you start writing code, it is crucial to understand how the three layers of SnapPass AI communicate:

```text
Browser (React Frontend)
    │
    │  HTTP (fetch / axios) via port 3000
    ▼
Express Backend (Node.js) ← runs on port 5000
    │
    │  HTTP (axios) forwarding images/data
    ▼
Python AI Service (Flask) ← runs on port 8000
```

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
Built with **React.js** and plain **CSS** (We strictly do **not** use Tailwind or CSS-in-JS to keep styling vanilla and accessible).
- Each component lives in its own `.js` + `.css` pair.
- State is managed with standard React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`).
- Custom hooks live in `src/hooks/`.
- All API calls are centralized and funnel through `src/services/photoService.js`.
- Routing is handled by `react-router-dom` in `src/routes/AppRoutes.js`.

### Backend (`backend/`)
Built with **Node.js + Express**.
- Follows a strict Routes → Controllers → Services architectural pattern.
- File uploads are securely handled by **Multer**.
- Acts as a middleman: all images are received here and forwarded to the Python service via Axios.
- MongoDB integration (via Mongoose) is planned for saving user sessions.

### Python AI Service (`python-ai-service/`)
Built with **Flask**.
- `bg_remove.py` — handles background removal using the `rembg` library.
- `face_center.py` — handles facial recognition, detection, & centering using OpenCV (`cv2`).
- `dpi_optimizer.py` — handles resizing to the correct physical dimensions (DPI) for the selected country preset.
- `sheet_generator.py` — handles arranging the finalized photos onto a printable A4 canvas using Pillow (`PIL`).

## 🛠️ Detailed Development Setup

Follow these exact steps to get the full project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Python](https://python.org/) (v3.9 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1 — Fork & Clone
```bash
# 1. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub repository.
# 2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SnapPass-AI.git

# 3. Navigate into the project folder:
cd SnapPass-AI

# 4. Add the original repository as 'upstream' to keep your fork updated with our latest changes:

```

### Step 2 — Run the Frontend (Required for UI Tasks)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start 
# Automatically opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```
> **Tip:** You don't necessarily need the backend or Python service running to work purely on the frontend UI. The frontend has simulated placeholders for API calls to help you design!

### Step 3 — Run the Backend (Required for Node.js Tasks)
Open a new terminal window:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev 
# The server will start and listen on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 4 — Run the Python AI Service (Required for Python/AI Tasks)
Open a new terminal window:
```bash
cd python-ai-service

# It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate   
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask server
python main.py
# The AI service will start and listen on http://localhost:8000
```

## 📐 Coding Standards

### JavaScript / React
- Use **functional components** with hooks exclusively (no class components).
- Each component must have **its own `.jsx` + `.css` file**.
- Use **highly descriptive variable names** (`uploadedFile` not `uf`, `handleFormSubmit` not `submit`).
- Add a **JSDoc comment block** at the top of every component and utility function.
- Keep components **focused**: if a file is over 200 lines, consider splitting it.
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when absolute reassignment is needed. Never use `var`.

```js
// ✅ Good
/**
 * UploadBox Component
 * Handles drag and drop photo uploading functionality.
 * @param {Object} props
 * @param {Function} props.onFileSelect - Callback fired when a file is chosen.
 */
function UploadBox({ onFileSelect }) { ... }

// ❌ Bad
function C(p) { ... }
```

### CSS
- **No Tailwind**, no CSS-in-JS — we use highly structured plain CSS.
- Utilize the **CSS variables** defined globally in `index.css` (e.g. `var(--color-primary)`).
- **Never use hardcoded hex colours** in components — always reference design tokens.
- All CSS files must be **strictly scoped to their component** (e.g. wrapping everything in `.upload-box {}`).
- Always include **responsive styles** using `@media (max-width: 768px)`.

```css
/* ✅ Good — uses design tokens, strictly scoped class names */
.upload-box {
  border: 2px dashed var(--color-border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  background: var(--color-bg);
}

/* ❌ Bad — hardcoded hex values, generic class name */
.box {
  border: 2px dashed #ccc;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background: #f8f8f8;
}
```

### Python
- Strictly follow **PEP 8** style guidelines.
- Add a comprehensive **docstring** to every single function and class.
- Import only exactly what you need (`from PIL import Image` rather than `import PIL`).
- Use **Type Hints** aggressively to make the code self-documenting.
- Handle errors gracefully: return `None` or a default value and print a warning rather than letting the server crash if a dependency or file is missing.

```python
# ✅ Good
from PIL import Image

def remove_background(image_path: str) -> Image:
    """
    Removes the background from the given image using the rembg library.
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): The absolute path to the input image file.
        
    Returns:
        Image: A Pillow Image object with a transparent background.
    """
    ...
```
